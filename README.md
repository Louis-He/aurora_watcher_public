## Overview

- **Purpose:** Communicate what we're planning for Aurora Watcher (iOS), collect public feedback, and let users report bugs or suggest features by opening issues.
- **Status:** Roadmap-focused. Code may be published here in the future; for now use issues for questions and feedback.

## Roadmap & Future Plans

Short-term (next 3 months)
- Let's get the first version available to the public and ship to the Apple Store!

Note: Timelines are estimates and may change. Opening issues and commenting on roadmap items helps prioritize work.

## How to Report Issues, Ask Questions, or Provide Feedback

We welcome issues from the public. To open an issue, use this repository's Issues tab and choose the appropriate type (bug, feature request, question, or feedback).

When creating an issue, please include:

Tips:
- Search existing issues before creating a new one to avoid duplicates.
